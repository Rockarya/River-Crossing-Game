# River Crossing Game

ABOUT MY RIVER CROSSING CHALLENGE GAME :

1) Playing arena consists of a river with some partitions in it. 

2) There are 2 players in the game, one at Top and another at Bottom (2 sides of the river bank). 

3) A player is safe when it is standing on a partition/slab.

4) There are two kinds of obstacles, moving and fixed. The player starts from the 
‘START’ partition and must reach the ‘END’ position for player 1 and the ‘END’ becomes ‘START’, ‘START’ becomes ‘END’ for Player 2. 

5) The moving obstacles move from left to right or right to left. 

6) The player can move up, down, left and right. 

7) Player dies once he/she touches any obstacle.

crossing fixed obstacles 5 points. 

9) Only one player is playing at a given point of time. 

10) Your aim is to make players reach the other end of the river.

		declared as winner.
